Pointcoin, a self created cryptocurrency, has all the same features of bitcoin except for difficulty in finding a new block.  This allows miners to use less compuational power to see the strengths and weaknesses of bitcoin.  


This code uses the [BTC Suite](https://github.com/btcsuite) library for
bitcoin.

- keypair.go: code for generating a bitcoin key pair (including its public address).
- spend.go: code for generating a bitcoin transaction.
- miner.go: code for mining cryptocurrency
This is intended for learning and exploration only!  IT WOULD BE VERY
FOOLISH TO SEND ANY SIGNIFICANT FUNDS TO ADDRESSES GENERATED OR USED IN
THIS CODE.
